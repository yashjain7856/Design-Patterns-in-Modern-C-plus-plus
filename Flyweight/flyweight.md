# Flyweight Coding Exercise
You are given a class called `Sentence`, which takes a string such as `"hello world"`. You need to provide an interface such that the indexer `(operator [] )` returns a `WordToken` that can be used to capitalize a particular word in the sentence.

Typical use would be something like:
```
Sentence sentence("hello world");
sentence[1].capitalize = true;
cout << sentence.str(); // prints "hello WORLD"
```
