# Proxy Coding Exercise
You are given the `Person` class and asked to write a `ResponsiblePerson` wrapper/proxy that does the following:

Allows person to drink unless they are younger than 18 (in that case, return "too young")

Allows person to drive unless they are younger than 16 (otherwise, "too young")

In case of driving while drink, returns "dead"

The interface of `ResponsiblePerson` has to match that of Person , except for the constructor, which takes an underlying `Person` object.
