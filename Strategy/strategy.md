# Strategy Coding Exercise
Consider the quadratic equation and its canonical solution:

![Discriminant](./discriminant.png)

The part `b^2-4*a*c` is called the discriminant. Suppose we want to provide an API with two different strategies for calculating the discriminant:

In `OrdinaryDiscriminantStrategy`, If the discriminant is negative, we return it as-is. This is OK, since our main API returns `std::complex`  numbers anyway.
In `RealDiscriminantStrategy`, if the discriminant is negative, the return value is NaN (not a number). NaN propagates throughout the calculation, so the equation solver gives two NaN values.
Please implement both of these strategies as well as the equation solver itself. With regards to plus-minus in the formula, please return the + result as the first element and - as the second.
